# CRF sequence tagging for Movie Queries

This coursework involves optimizing the performance of a **Conditional Random Field (CRF) sequence tagger** for movie trivia questions and answers data, which consist of instances of data of word sequences with the target classes/labels for each word in a **BIO (Beginning, Inside, Outside)** tagging format. 

This assignment involves reading in, pre-processing, training and developing a tagger on the training data from *trivia10k13train.bio.txt*, and finally testing the tagger on the data *trivia10k13test.bio.txt*, attempting to get the best performing tagger across the different labels in the development process.
