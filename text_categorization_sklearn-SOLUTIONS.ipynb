      "to the human eye, one using continuous tones, and the other using\n",

      "images, then the two ramps should look symmetrical, and the point\n",
      "at which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half\n",
      "way from the top to the bottom. (To find this point it helps if\n",
      "you move away a little from the screen, and de-focus your eyes a\n",
      "bit.)\n",
      "\n",
      "If your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then left hand ramp will have\n",
      "a long dark part and a short white part, and the point of equal brightness\n",
      "will be above the center.\n",

      "for a display, then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the\n",
      "gamma, and decrease it if it is below the center. The value will usually be\n",
      "around 2.2 \n",
      "\n",
      "[with xli for instance, you can adjust the display gamma with the\n",

      "How do I figure out what the gamma of an image is ?\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the most tricky bit. As a general rule it seems that a lot of\n",
      "true color (ie. 24 bit, .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of\n",
      "1.0 (linear), although there are many about that have some gamma\n",
      "correction. It seems that the majority of pseudo color images\n",
      "(ie. 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc.) are gamma corrected\n",
      "to some degree or other.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will\n",

      "Why Linear images are sometimes not such a good thing\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the reason that many high quality formats (such as\n",
      "Video) use gamma correction is that it actually makes better\n",
      "use of the storage medium. This is because the human\n",
      "eye has a logarithmic response to light, and gamma correction\n",
      "has a similar compression characteristic. This means images \n",
      "could make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance),\n",
      "if they used gamma correction. The implication though, is that\n",
      "every time you want to do any image processing you should\n",
      "convert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain\n",
      "the same accuracy. Since little popular software does this, and\n",
      "none of the popular image formats can agree on a standard\n",
      "gamma correction factor, it is difficult to justify gamma corrected\n",
      "images at the popular level.\n",
      "\n",
      "If some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma,\n",
      "and if image manipulation software takes care to use\n",
      "extra precision when dealing with linearized internal data,\n",
      "then gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "(I am told that the Kodak PhotoCD format for instance, has a\n",
      "standard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the\n",

      "and are still simmering.\n",
      "     You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that \n",
      "earns $100,000-plus and get the same results.  Since the majority \n",

    "\n",
    "Performing error analyses is a key part of improving your NLP applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Iterate over the twenty_test.data and, using the list of predictions and labels, print out all the instances where there is a false positive for that class in the sequence (i.e. a false positive is where the label is predicted for a given instance, but this is not the corresponding ground truth label). Format the printed sequences to make it as clear as possible where the error is in the sequence for a given label. \n",
    "\n",
    "HINT: This may be achieved most easily by editing the cell above beginning with the comment `# Print out some predictions against the labels`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each class's False Positives, think about which features could be added to reduce the number of these errors. The idea is to try to understand where and why the classify mistakenly classifies something as a certain class when it is not of that class. Think about trying some ways to get rid of these errors based on extra features (meta-features like document length, different types of pre-processing, feature extraction etc.)."

    "LR is a very precise classifier out of the box for alt.atheism (Prec=0.96) with few FPs and the few false alarms included soc.religion.christian emails which mention atheists and atheism several times, which is an understandable misclassification. The confusion with comp.graphics in interesting: one mistake was the email with \"Where did the hacker ethic go?\" in the header, where presumably the word \"ethic\" is frequent in atheism articles. Bigram features may help here as \"hacker ethic\" is lightly to discriminate better.\n",
    "\n",
    "## soc.religion.christian\n",
    "Precision is slightly lower for soc.religion.christian (Prec=0.87), mainly due to the false classification of alt.atheism documents as soc.religion.christian. Quite a lot of the text in these errorful documents are embedded reviews/replies/comments on emails or texts from Christians e.g. \">The fact is God could cause you to believe anything He wants you to.\" is an inline email quotation indicated by â>â. Given this, some more structured feature input which identifies embedded replies/reviews as different to the main text could help. Sometimes not cleaning all the formatting and special characters is a good idea before using them for feature extraction. The word \"Christians\" is often used in the alt.atheism emails as othering a group rather than talking about themselves- this is semantically difficult to identify.\n",
    "\n",
    "## comp.graphics\n",
    "comp.graphics has the lowest class precision out of all the classes (Prec=0.83). The most common false prediction is on sci.med documents. There are some words that look potentially relevant to comp.graphics which appear in sci.med emails such as \"email\" and \"colleges\". There are a number of mentions of \"data\", which relates across the disciplines. Some look like a genuine blend of topics, as indicated by sentences/headers like \"allergic reactions against laser printers??\". We would have to do a full feature ranking to see how predictive words are for each class (e.g. show the mutual information of each word with each class and list them in order of their informativeness).\n",

    "sci.med has a high precision (Prec=0.93) and the biggest number of false predictions is on alt.atheism texts. Upon inspection a number of the texts about atheism include scientific vocabulary, including the word \"theory\". The difference is that the atheism texts are putting arguments forward about science, rather than assuming a scientific area of practice and discussion.

The majority of these mistakes are the misclassification as soc.religion.christian, for the reasons given in the FP for soc.religion.christian above. The errors of misclassifying as sci.med and soc.religion.christian are discussed above. It is less clear why the false classifications of comp.graphics are happening- again, email addresses, email headers and other metadata could be worth separating out in the features.\n",

The few misclassifications as soc.religion.christian look to have religious/Christian language in them, e.g. \"SREBRENICA'S DOCTOR RECOUNTS TOWN'S LIVING HELL\", suggesting the limits of a unigram/bag-of-words approach."
